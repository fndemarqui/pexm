Version: 1.0.0
Description: Load the Just Another Gibbs Sampling (JAGS) module "pexm". The module provides the tools to work with the Piecewise Exponential (PE) distribution in a Bayesian model with the corresponding Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Gibbs Sampling) implemented via JAGS. Details about the module implementation can be found in Mayrink et al. (2020) <arXiv:2004.12359>.
